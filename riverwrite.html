    <h3>How do we collect, use, and share user data?</h3>
    <p>We collect an email, password, and the saved writing a user. We store this data within our own databases and nowhere else.</p>
    <p>We use a users email and password to authenticate them so that we can give them their saved and stored writing.</p>
     <p>Some user writing is stored locally on their device, while writing from our "rooms" is stored in our records and not used in any way besides being edited and shown.</p>
    <h3>What parties is this data shared with?</h3>
    <p>All stored user data is stored within our records and is not shared with any remote parties or any other parties in general.</p>
