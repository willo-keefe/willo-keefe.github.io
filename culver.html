    <h3>How do we collect, use, and share user data?</h3>
    <p>There are only three different bits of information that Culver Shot collects from users. Culver Shot collects user preferences when it comes to vibrations and sound, user game score, and an anonymous unique user ID that is used to retrieve user score for each user.</p>
    <p>There are no third parties involved, and there is no personally identifiable information or sensitive data that is managed</p>
